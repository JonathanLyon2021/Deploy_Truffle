# Deploy_Truffle
This is Exercise-3 from MI4 in Kingsland Universities Blockchain Developer Program
# Goals
The goal of this exercise is to create smart contract, compile and deploy it using the Truffle Framework and add unit
tests for the contract logic using Truffle. We will deploy the smart contract in Ganache-CLI with Truffle. Then write
unit tests for the smart contract and test it with Truffle. The contract will be written in Solidity. Before we get
started, you must have Truffle and Ganache-cli installed. Ganache-cli will be the tool we will use to create a private
blockchain that runs on our machine only.

# Prerequisites
• Ganache CLI v6.12.2
• Truffle v5.4.15
• Solidity 0.8.7+commit.e28d00a7.Emscripten.clang (solc-js)
